## Q13

```{r}
# read in the file
pop <- read.table('rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt')
```

```{r}
summary(pop[pop$geno=='A/G',])
```

**The genotype A/G has sample size 233 and median 25.065.**

```{r}
summary(pop[pop$geno=='A/A',])
```

**The genotype A/A has sample size 108 and median 31.25**

```{r}
summary(pop[pop$geno=='G/G',])
```

**The genotype G/G has sample size 121 and median 20.074.**

## Q14

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pop)+
  aes(geno, exp, fill=geno)+
  geom_boxplot(notch = T)+
  labs(x='Genotypes', y='ORMDL3 Expression')
```

**Comparing A/A and G/G, we can infer that homozygous A/A is correlated with a significantly higher ORMDL3 expression level. Combining with the fact that one allele changing to G results in a intermediate expression level, we can propose that allele A is a "stronger" allele correlated with high ORMDL3 expression, whereas G is a "weaker" allele.**
